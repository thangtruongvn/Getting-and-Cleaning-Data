This is quoted from the site <"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"> about the data collected in the experiments:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."
In the scope of this project, we merge the training and test data sets and only pick out the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. Then create the data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
The result data are got from files: 
train/X_train.txt, test/X_test.txt : include values of the measurements of all the features for the activities and the subjects which are devided into train and test sets. 
features.txt : give the feature(measurement) ids and names.
train/y_train.txt, test/y_test.txt : provide ids of the activities for train and test sets.
activity_labels.txt : provides the ids and labels of the activities.
train/subject_train.txt, test/subject_test.txt : include ids of subjects in the train and test sets.

Below are the list of variables in the latest result data set, in that, the variables from 3 to 68 are the measurements of mean and standard deviation, the variable 1 and 2 ("activity", "subject") and added to perform grouping the data. The result data set in the uploaded file "avg_by_activity_subject.txt" present the average of the measurements for each activity and each subject.

mean() is Mean value.
std() is Standard deviation. 
Here are the details of the measurements from the file "features_info.txt":

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."
